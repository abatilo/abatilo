### My name is Aaron! :wave:

It's nice of you to drop by.

These days I play a lot with Go / Golang and I'm a massive fan boy of Kubernetes. I was an early adopter of GitHub Actions and even co-created a (now retired) website that let you manually execute GitHub Actions months before GitHub released the ability the official ability to [manually trigger GitHub Actions](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/). GitHub was even one of our users for a while.

If you're working on any cool operations tools or looking for help scaling your applications and infrastructure, read about me in detail on [my website](https://www.aaronbatilo.dev/about) and let me know if I'd be a good fit to help out!

My website runs as an nginx container, running on my own EKS cluster, exposed through Istio. Is it overkill? Most definitely, but it's fun to play with these toys anyways. My contact information is on my website. I hope to hear from you soon. :clap:
